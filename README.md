# Haraka Coming Soon Page
## Joomla System Plugin

## Download

Download 1.0.14 https://github.com/brianteeman/haraka/releases/tag/1.0.14

### Description
While you are developing your web site this plugin will hide the site behind a Coming Soon Page. You can customise the text and select from a combination of over 100 styles. An optional countdown clock and social media links can be displayed. Additionally you can give a secret word, or whitelist one or more IP addresses, to allow access to the site while it is under development.

### 1.0.14 Release Notes
Updated language strings to allow the countdown to be localised - thanks to the translators for updating so quickly
### 1.0.13 Release Notes
This release fixes the IP address whitelist - thanks to @zero-24
### 1.0.12 Release Notes
This release adds a slight dark overlay to the image, but before the white text, so that when a light image is used, the text is still visible.
### 1.0.11 Release Notes
This release adds the German language - there are no code changes

#### Updates
Note that version 1.0.0 can not be updated with the Joomla update system - you will need to download and reinstall and then go to the Extensions->Manage->Update Sites and click on Rebuild. Updates from 1.0.3 onwards will be handled by the joomla update servers
